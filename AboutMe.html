          <p style="margin-right: 250px;">​In my mission to explore the technology, I constantly seek out new and 
            emerging trends. Like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, I look 
            into the latest innovations, eagerly absorbing knowledge and experimenting 
            with cutting-edge tools. The fast-paced nature of the tech world keeps me 
            on my toes, pushing me to adapt, learn, and stay ahead of the curve. With 
            each new discovery, I am excited by the boundless potential technology holds 
            to shape the future and make a positive impact on the world.

            As a 14-year-old tech inspired teen, I am excited to be part of this ever-evolving landscape 
            and look forward to the endless possibilities that lie ahead. I have learned 
            from HGI Middle School from grade 6 to 8, joined track and basketball team. 
            Then, continued my journey with PTEC at Shaftesbury High School. At 14 years 
            old, I have already developed a range of skills that contribute to my identity 
            as a tech enthusiast.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            One of my primary strengths lies in coding and programming. 
            I am skilled in various programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and 
            HTML/CSS, allowing me to build websites, develop simple applications, and games. 
            Additionally, I have developed problem-solving and logical thinking skills, 
            through coding challenges and projects. You can check out these projects on my 
            "Working Samples" page.</p>
